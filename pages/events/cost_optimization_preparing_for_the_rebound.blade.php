                                <p class="mb-4 webcontent">In the era of the pandemic, the economy is facing a critical hit. Many companies are trying their best to adapt to this new environment. When there is expected to be a rebound in the future,
                                    enterprises must first endure through the virus. To do so, cost optimization is vital.<br><br>
                                    <h5>1. Salary Cut of Management level</h5>
                                    <p class="webcontent">It is not rare to see in the news that the management level of some global companies are having salary cut to aid the companies in this critical situation. Other than the actual cut of cost,
                                        such act
                                        gives encouragement to other employees that the management is standing with the companies so as other employees.</p>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h5>2. Monitoring Efficiency of the Companies</h5>
                                    <p class="webcontent">During a critical condition, it is especially important to make sure every unit of resources of the company is put in the right place. This is particularly true when working from home is
                                        common due to
                                        social distancing. Companies might have to come up with new monitoring or reporting systems. Keep the communication between employees and the management effective could be a vital part of utilizing the
                                        resources.</p>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h5>3. Headcount Management</h5>
                                    <p class="webcontent">A cut of headcount could be a way to ease the financial burden of the company in a critical time. The management of headcount does not necessarily mean a cut of it but also the change of
                                        proportion of
                                        contracted role and permanent role. The company could make temporary changes during this period and restore after the rebound.</p>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h5>4. Outsourcing of Operation</h5>
                                    <p class="webcontent">When the operation of the company remains costly during the pandemic period, companies could consider outsourcing some parts of their operations to other companies to reduce the operation
                                        cost. The
                                        outsourcing could reduce the operation cost and sometimes even raise the productivity of the company due to specialization.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Although it is a tough period of time for business, it is also a golden opportunity for them. When one survives until the end of the pandemic while many are eliminated during the issue, they would have a
                                        huge boost in development. Warm spring would come after this tough winter.</p>
